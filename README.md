# RASApred
A machine learning based computational framework to classify Ayurvedic herbs into their Rasa classes

# Model Generation
A suite of multiclass classification models has been developed using classical machine learning methods, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). We have also used deep learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep neural networks (DNN), to develop multi-class classifiers.
